<summary><h3>üìã Known Issues & Solutions</h3></summary>

#### üîß Camera Issues
If you find the character is off-screen after teleporting, or the camera doesn't follow character movement (character walks directly out of screen boundaries), this is usually caused by skipping the game's camera transition mechanism during teleportation. For solutions, please refer to the Safe Respawn function in the [Troubleshooting Guide](#troubleshooting).

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Teleporting to Unlocked Entry Points  
Both teleportation and Safe Respawn functions may sometimes teleport the character to unlocked entry points. Due to potential obstacles at unlocked entrances, the character might be "pushed into" unexpected closed areas. If you find yourself trapped in a scene that you cannot normally exit, please:
- Use **Teleport to Bench** function to return to the last save point
- Or use **Emergency Teleport** to return to a safe location
- Temporarily avoid saving coordinates in such areas

üìç **Special Note**: The "MEMORIUM" scene (requires double jump to reach) is prone to this issue. If teleported there before unlocking double jump, you will be trapped in the scene, please be extra careful.

### Safety Guidelines

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Please follow these safety guidelines to avoid game bugs and data corruption!**

#### When it's safe to use:
‚úÖ Only save or teleport when your **character is fully controllable**  
‚úÖ In **normal game scenes**, when **not in combat**

#### Dangerous situations - DO NOT use:
‚ùå **During boss battles**  
‚ùå **Inside closed combat areas**  
‚ùå **During cutscenes or animations**  
‚ùå **When character is controlled or immobilized**  
‚ùå **During any special states or triggered events**

#### Important Notes:
‚ö†Ô∏è **Avoid multiple teleportations in short time** (like teleporting multiple times within 1 second)  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not teleport immediately after death**

---

### Troubleshooting:

#### üÜò If stuck/camera lost/character floating and unable to open menu:

1. **First try: Safe Respawn** (Keyboard: `Alt+6`, Gamepad: `LB+RB+Y`)  
   If teleported to entry point, then use load position as needed  
   > üí° Example: If character is off-screen after loading save, or camera doesn't follow character movement, use `Alt+6` safe respawn, then reload the same save slot coordinates to fix camera/view issues

2. **Character completely out of control, or character floating and not landing: Emergency return to main menu** (Keyboard: `Ctrl+F9`, no gamepad shortcut)  
   > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: **Do NOT use emergency return to main menu when character is dead**

3. **Still not working, completely unresponsive: Restart the game**

---

#### üö® All save data lost or stuck in a scene:

If all your **save slots are lost** or you're trapped in an unescapable scene, use **Emergency Teleport** (Keyboard: `Alt+-` [minus key], Gamepad: `LB+RB+X`) to instantly teleport to a **preset safe location** (starting town station).

> **This works independently of your save data**

---

### Emergency rescue config:

If all methods fail, you can **manually edit the save file** with this safe config:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** **Close the game first**, modify and save, then restart the game, and load slot 1 after entering the game (Keyboard: `Alt+1`, Gamepad: `LB+RB+Up`)

```json
{
  "saveSlots": {
    "1": {
      "x": 71.42231,
      "y": 9.597684,
      "z": 0.004,
      "scene": "Bellway_01",
      "hasData": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Slot 1 defaults to the station in the starting town, which is absolutely safe.**
